TASK 2
Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮

A Tic-Tac-Toe game where the human player (X) competes against an unbeatable AI (O). The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally and either win or force a draw.

✅Minimax AI (no random moves)

✅Command-line interface

TASK 3
Recommendation System 🎬

In this task, I developed a simple content-based movie recommendation system using Python. The system suggests movies that are similar to a movie selected by the user, based on genre similarity.

✅Built using pandas and scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer + cosine similarity)

✅Takes movie title input from the user at runtime

✅Recommends the top 3 most similar movies

TASK 4
Image Captioning AI 🖼️

In this task, I developed an Image Captioning AI system that combines Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate meaningful captions for images.

✅ Computer Vision — Extracted image features using pre-trained CNN (ResNet)

✅ NLP — Generated captions with a Transformer decoder (BLIP)

✅ Transfer Learning — Applied pre-trained models effectively

✅ PyTorch + Transformers — Built using powerful AI libraries

✅ Image Processing — Resized, normalized, and prepared image data
